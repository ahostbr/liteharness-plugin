description: Use when needing to discover, search, list, or describe available skills, commands, and agents across all codebases and locations. Triggers on 'library', 'list skills', 'what skills do I have', 'find a skill', 'show all agents', 'what commands are available', 'list my agentics', 'catalog', 'describe this agent', 'what does this skill do'. Also trigger on 'do I have a skill for [topic]', 'is there an agent for [topic]', 'what commands exist in [project]', 'describe [agent-name]', 'tell me about [skill-name]', 'what polymathic agents exist', 'list commands in <project>', or any question checking whether a specific skill, command, or agent exists or requesting an inventory of available agentics.

# Library — Agentics Catalog & Discovery

One command to see everything. Catalogs all skills, commands, and agents across every location into a searchable YAML index.

## Commands

| Command      | Usage                      | Purpose                                                 |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **list**     | `/library list`            | Show full catalog grouped by location then category     |
| **search**   | `/library search <query>`  | Filter catalog by keyword (name, category, description) |
| **describe** | `/library describe <name>` | Read source file and summarize a specific item          |
| **refresh**  | `/library refresh`         | Re-scan all sources, update library.yaml                |
| **register** | `/library register <path>` | Add a new codebase to scan                              |

## Workflow by Command

### list

1. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/library.yaml`
2. Group entries by `source` (location), then sub-group by `category`
3. Display using this format per group:

```
## <Source Name> (<count>)

### <Category>
- <name> (<type>) — <description>
```

**First-use auto-populate:** The catalog ships **empty** (template). If `catalog:` is empty or missing, automatically run the **refresh** workflow below to scan the user's `sources` and build the catalog for their machine, then continue with `list`. Don't make the user run `/library refresh` manually — just do it.

### search

1. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/library.yaml`
2. Filter catalog entries where `query` appears in name, category, OR description (case-insensitive)
3. Display matches using same grouped format as `list`
4. Show match count: "Found N items matching '<query>'"

### describe

1. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/library.yaml`
2. Find entry matching `<name>` (fuzzy — partial match OK)
3. If multiple matches, list them and ask user to clarify
4. Read the source file at the entry's `path`
5. Present: name, type, source, category, full path, then a **concise summary** (not the entire file)

### refresh

This is the core workflow. Scan all registered sources and rebuild the catalog.

1. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/library.yaml` to get `sources` section
2. For each source, scan using its `scan_pattern` or `scan` paths
3. For each discovered file, extract metadata:

**Extraction rules by file type:**

| File type                    | Name                      | Description                                 | Category            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| SKILL.md (with frontmatter)  | `name:` field             | `description:` field, first sentence only   | From taxonomy below |
| Command .md                  | Filename without .md      | First non-heading paragraph, first sentence | From taxonomy below |
| Agent .md (with frontmatter) | `name:` field or filename | `description:` field, first sentence        | From taxonomy below |
| Agent .md (no frontmatter)   | Filename without .md      | First paragraph, first sentence             | From taxonomy below |
| Other .md                    | Filename without .md      | First paragraph, first sentence             | From taxonomy below |

**Category assignment heuristics:**

| Pattern                                                                                                                                                                                       | Category      |

4. Write updated catalog back to `library.yaml`, preserving the `sources` section
5. Report: "Refreshed: N skills, M commands, K agents across L sources"

**Important:** Use Glob to discover files, Read to extract metadata. Do NOT use Bash for scanning.

### register

1. Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/library.yaml`
2. Add new source entry with the provided path:
   ```yaml
   new-source:
     path: "<user-provided-path>"
     type: registered
     scan:
       - ".claude/skills/*/SKILL.md"
       - ".claude/commands/*.md"
       - ".claude/agents/*.md"
       - "ai/skills/**/*.md"
   ```
3. Derive source name from the directory name (e.g., `/home/user/my-project` becomes `my-project`)
4. Run refresh for just that source
5. Report what was found

## Filtering Tips

When the user asks vague questions, map to search:

- "what marketing skills do I have?" → `/library search marketing`
- "do I have anything for testing?" → `/library search testing`
- "what can I use for planning?" → `/library search planning`
- "show me all polymathic agents" → `/library search polymathic`
- "what's in <project>?" → `/library search <project>` (matches source field)

## Notes

- The YAML file is a **read index** — Claude reads skills from their source path, never copies them
- Refresh is idempotent — safe to run repeatedly
- Categories are best-effort heuristics — manually edit the YAML to fix misassignments
- When scanning a registered codebase, skip directories without `.claude/` or `ai/skills/`
- Superpowers version directory is dynamic — scan for the latest version subfolder
