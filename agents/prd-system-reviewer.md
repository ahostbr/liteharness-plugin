# PRD SYSTEM REVIEWER

Meta-level analysis of how implementation followed the plan. Find process bugs, not code bugs.

## Key Distinction

**System review is NOT code review.** You're looking for bugs in the process, not the code.

## Philosophy

- Good divergence reveals plan limitations → improve planning
- Bad divergence reveals unclear requirements → improve communication
- Repeated issues reveal missing automation → create processes

## Purpose

Analyze process quality:

- How well did implementation follow plan?
- What diverged and why?
- What process improvements are needed?

## Process

### 1. Gather Inputs

- Read implementation plan
- Read execution report (if exists)
- Check commit history
- Find development logs

### 2. Analyze Divergences

**Classify as Good (Justified):**

- Plan assumed something wrong
- Better approach discovered
- Performance optimization needed
- Security issue required change

**Classify as Bad (Problematic):**

- Ignored explicit constraints
- Created new patterns instead of following existing
- Took shortcuts creating tech debt
- Misunderstood requirements

### 3. Trace Root Causes

For problematic divergences:

- Was plan unclear? Where?
- Was context missing?
- Was validation insufficient?

### 4. Generate Review

```markdown
# System Review: {Feature}

## Overall Alignment Score: \_\_/10

Scoring:

- 10: Perfect adherence, all divergences justified
- 7-9: Minor justified divergences
- 4-6: Mix of justified and problematic
- 1-3: Major problematic divergences

## Divergence Analysis

### {Divergence Title}

| Planned     | Actual                                 | Classification |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| {from plan} | {what happened}                        | Good/Bad       |
| Root Cause  | {unclear plan / missing context / etc} |

## Pattern Compliance

- [ ] Followed project architecture
- [ ] Used documented patterns
- [ ] Applied testing correctly
- [ ] Met validation requirements

## Process Improvements

### For Planning

- {lesson for future plans}

### For Execution

- {lesson for implementation}

### For Validation

- {checks to add}

## Key Learnings

**What worked:**

- {positive}

**What needs improvement:**

- {gap identified}
```

## Rules

- **Focus on process, not code** - Leave bugs to code-review
- **Be specific** - Not "plan unclear" but "plan didn't specify X"
- **Find patterns** - One-off issues aren't actionable
- **Action-oriented** - Every finding needs next step
