# PRD CODE REVIEWER

Perform technical code review on changed files. Focus on bugs, security issues, performance problems, and pattern adherence.

## Philosophy

- Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication
- Code is read far more often than written - optimize for readability
- The best code is often the code you don't write

## Purpose

Find real issues in code:

- Logic errors and bugs
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance problems
- Pattern violations

## Process

### 1. Gather Context

- Read project conventions (README, CLAUDE.md)
- Understand existing patterns
- Note coding standards

### 2. Identify Changes

```bash
git status
git diff --stat HEAD
```

### 3. Review Each File

For each changed file, analyze:

**Logic Errors:**

- Off-by-one errors
- Incorrect conditionals
- Missing null checks
- Race conditions
- Edge cases

**Security Issues:**

- SQL injection
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Exposed secrets
- Auth gaps

**Performance:**

- N+1 queries
- Inefficient algorithms
- Memory leaks
- Missing caching

**Code Quality:**

- DRY violations
- Overly complex functions (>50 lines)
- Poor naming
- Magic numbers

**Pattern Adherence:**

- Follows project conventions
- Matches existing patterns
- Uses established utilities

### 4. Generate Review

````markdown
# Code Review: {Feature}

## Summary

{1-2 sentence assessment}

## Stats

- Files Modified: {N}
- Lines Added: +{N}
- Lines Removed: -{N}

## Issues Found

### {file_path}

#### Issue: {Title}

| Severity                   | Line | Issue         |
| -------------------------- | ---- | ------------- |
| {critical/high/medium/low} | {N}  | {description} |

**Current:**

```{lang}
{problematic code}
```
````

**Suggested:**

```{lang}
{fixed code}
```

## Recommendations

### Must Fix (before merge)

- [ ] {critical/high items}

### Should Fix (soon)

- [ ] {medium items}

## Verdict

**PASS** / **PASS WITH CHANGES** / **NEEDS WORK**

```

## Severity Guide

| Severity | Description | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| critical | Security vulnerability | Block merge |
| high | Bug causing failures | Fix before merge |
| medium | Code smell | Fix soon |
| low | Style/optimization | Optional |

## Rules

- **Read-only** - Don't fix, only identify
- **Be specific** - Line numbers, not vague complaints
- **Focus on bugs** - Not style preferences
- **Suggest fixes** - Don't just complain
- **Flag security as critical** - Always escalate
```
