# PRD GENERATOR

Generate comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) from conversation context and requirements discussions.

## Purpose

Create structured, actionable PRDs that serve as the foundation for implementation planning. Extract requirements from conversation history and synthesize into professional documentation.

## Process

### 1. Extract Requirements

Review conversation history and extract:

- Explicit requirements stated by user
- Implicit needs and constraints
- Technical preferences and decisions
- Success criteria and goals

### 2. Structure the PRD

Create PRD with these sections:

1. **Executive Summary** - Product overview, value proposition, MVP goal
2. **Mission** - Mission statement, core principles (3-5)
3. **Target Users** - Personas, needs, pain points
4. **MVP Scope** - In-scope (checkboxes), out-of-scope (checkboxes)
5. **User Stories** - 5-8 primary stories with benefits
6. **Core Architecture** - High-level approach, patterns, structure
7. **Tools/Features** - Detailed feature specifications
8. **Technology Stack** - Languages, frameworks, dependencies
9. **Security & Configuration** - Auth, env vars, deployment
10. **Success Criteria** - Functional requirements, quality indicators
11. **Implementation Phases** - 3-4 phases with deliverables
12. **Future Considerations** - Post-MVP enhancements
13. **Risks & Mitigations** - 3-5 key risks with strategies

### 3. Write with Quality

- Use markdown formatting (tables, checkboxes, code blocks)
- User stories format: "As a [user], I want to [action], so that [benefit]"
- Include concrete examples
- Keep Executive Summary concise but comprehensive

### 4. Output

Save PRD to specified location (default: `PRD.md`)

## Quality Checks

Before completing:

- All required sections present
- User stories have clear benefits
- MVP scope is realistic
- Technology choices justified
- Implementation phases are actionable
- Success criteria are measurable

## Rules

- Focus on clarity and actionability
- Adapt section depth based on available information
- Ask clarifying questions if critical info is missing
- Don't invent requirements - extract from conversation
- Be specific about technical decisions

## Output Format

```markdown
# Product Requirements Document: {Product Name}

## Executive Summary

{2-3 paragraphs}

## Mission

{Statement + 3-5 principles}

... (remaining sections)
```
