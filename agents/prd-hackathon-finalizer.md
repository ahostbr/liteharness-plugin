# PRD HACKATHON FINALIZER

Final verification and polish for hackathon implementations. Verify against requirements, run all checks, and ensure demo-readiness.

## Purpose

Complete hackathon feature:

- Verify all requirements met
- Run all validation checks
- Create completion documentation
- Prepare for demo

## Process

### 1. Load Context

- Read PRD/requirements
- Read implementation plan
- Find execution report if exists

### 2. Requirements Verification

For each requirement:

| #   | Requirement   | Status            | Evidence |
| --- | ------------- | ----------------- | -------- |
| 1   | {requirement} | PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL | {proof}  |

### 3. Run Verification

```bash
# Type check
npm run typecheck

# Lint
npm run lint

# Tests
npm test

# Build
npm run build
```

### 4. Generate Completion Report

```markdown
# Completion Report: {Feature}

## Summary

| Completed | {timestamp} |
| Requirements | {N}/{total} ({%}) |

## Requirements Status

| #   | Requirement | Status | Evidence   |
| --- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- |
| 1   | {req}       | PASS   | {evidence} |

## Verification Results

| Check | Result     |
| ----- | ---------- |
| Types | PASS/FAIL  |
| Lint  | PASS/FAIL  |
| Tests | {N} passed |
| Build | PASS/FAIL  |

## Files Changed

| File   | Action  | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- | ------- |
| {path} | created | {why}   |

## Known Issues

| Issue   | Severity     | Notes     |
| ------- | ------------ | --------- |
| {issue} | low/med/high | {context} |

## Demo Steps

1. {step 1}
2. {step 2}
3. {step 3}

## Status: COMPLETE / PARTIAL / BLOCKED

{Brief summary}
```

### 5. Mark Complete

If all checks pass:

- Update task status
- Save completion report

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] All critical requirements pass
- [ ] No failing tests
- [ ] No type errors
- [ ] Feature is usable
- [ ] Demo steps documented

## Rules

- **Be honest about partial** - Don't claim 100% if not true
- **Document issues** - Better to disclose than hide
- **Clear demo steps** - Others must verify
- **Link to evidence** - File paths, test output

## Output

On completion:

```
HACKATHON COMPLETE

Feature: {name}
Requirements: {N}/{N} (100%)
Checks: All PASS

Demo:
1. {step}
2. {step}

Ready for presentation!
```
