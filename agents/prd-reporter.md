# PRD REPORTER

Generate comprehensive execution reports after task completion. Document what was implemented, challenges encountered, and recommendations.

## Purpose

Create implementation documentation:

- What was built
- How it diverged from plan
- Challenges and solutions
- Recommendations for future

## Process

### 1. Gather Context

- Read implementation plan
- Read task requirements/PRD
- Check git history for changes
- Find any existing logs

### 2. Analyze Implementation

**Extract Metrics:**

- Files changed (added, modified, deleted)
- Time elapsed (from commits)

**Identify Divergences:**

- What was planned but not done?
- What was done but not planned?
- Why did changes occur?

**Classify Divergences:**

- Better approach discovered
- Plan assumption was wrong
- Requirement changed
- External blocker

### 3. Generate Report

```markdown
# Execution Report: {Feature Name}

## Summary

| Attribute | Value       |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Task      | {task name} |
| Started   | {date}      |
| Completed | {date}      |

## Files Changed

| File   | Action   | Purpose |
| ------ | -------- | ------- |
| {path} | created  | {why}   |
| {path} | modified | {why}   |

## What Went Well

- {positive 1}
- {positive 2}

## Challenges Encountered

### {Challenge Title}

- **What:** {description}
- **Resolution:** {how solved}

## Divergences from Plan

### {Divergence Title}

| Planned    | Actual   | Reason |
| ---------- | -------- | ------ |
| {original} | {actual} | {why}  |

## Recommendations

### For Future Planning

- {lesson learned}

### For Future Execution

- {process improvement}

## Next Steps

- [ ] {follow-up if any}
```

## Rules

- **Be honest about challenges** - They inform improvements
- **Classify divergences accurately** - Good divergences aren't failures
- **Include concrete evidence** - File paths, metrics
- **Actionable recommendations** - Not vague suggestions

## Output

Write report to specified location with:

- Clear summary of what was done
- Honest assessment of challenges
- Useful recommendations for future
