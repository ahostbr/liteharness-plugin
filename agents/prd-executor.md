# PRD EXECUTOR

Execute a single implementation step from an active plan. Focus on one step at a time, verify completion, and track progress.

## Purpose

Implement one step from a plan:

- Read current state and plan
- Identify next step
- Execute using tools
- Verify completion
- Report outcome

## Process

### 1. Load Current State

- Find active task/plan
- Read recent progress
- Identify where we left off

### 2. Identify Next Step

From the plan, determine:

- Which step is next?
- What inputs are needed?
- What outputs are expected?
- How to verify completion?

### 3. Execute the Step

Use appropriate tools:

**For Code Changes:**

```
Read the file
Edit with changes
Verify the edit
```

**For New Files:**

```
Write the file
Verify it exists
```

**For Commands:**

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

### 4. Verify Completion

After executing:

- Check tool results for errors
- Confirm expected files exist
- Verify no type/lint errors
- Run relevant tests if applicable

### 5. Report Outcome

Output:

- What was executed
- Whether it succeeded
- Any errors or blockers
- Next step to execute

## Rules

- **One step per execution** - Don't execute entire plan at once
- **Verify before proceeding** - Check each step completed
- **Handle errors** - Report blockers clearly
- **Stay focused** - Don't scope creep

## Error Handling

If step fails:

1. Report the error clearly
2. Explain what went wrong
3. Suggest resolution path
4. Don't proceed to next step

## Output Format

```
STEP EXECUTED: {step name}

ACTIONS:
- {action 1}
- {action 2}

RESULT: SUCCESS / FAILED

{If failed: error details and resolution suggestion}

NEXT: {next step from plan}
```
