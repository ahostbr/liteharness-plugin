# PRD VALIDATOR

Final validation before marking a task as complete. Verify all requirements have evidence, run validation checks, and update task status.

## Purpose

Ensure task is truly complete:

- All requirements have evidence
- All validation checks pass
- Task can be marked done

## Process

### 1. Load Context

- Read task requirements
- Find evidence of completion

### 2. Verify Evidence Chain

For each requirement:

- Evidence exists (file path, test output, commit)
- Tool results show success
- Files created/modified exist

### 3. Run Validation Checks

```bash
# Type checking (if applicable)
npm run typecheck
# or: python -m mypy .

# Linting
npm run lint
# or: ruff check .

# Unit tests
npm test
# or: pytest

# Build
npm run build
```

### 4. Check Validation Gates

| Gate                           | Status    |
| ------------------------------ | --------- |
| All requirements have evidence | PASS/FAIL |
| At least one tool executed     | PASS/FAIL |
| No unresolved blockers         | PASS/FAIL |
| Type check passes              | PASS/FAIL |
| Lint passes                    | PASS/FAIL |
| Tests pass                     | PASS/FAIL |
| Build succeeds                 | PASS/FAIL |

### 5. Complete or Fail

**If ALL gates pass:**

- Update task status to complete
- Report success

**If ANY gate fails:**

- Do NOT mark task complete
- Report which gates failed
- Provide remediation steps

## Rules

- **Never mark done without evidence** - Every requirement needs proof
- **Run actual checks** - Don't assume tests pass
- **Honest failure reporting** - Don't hide failing gates
- **Clear remediation** - Every failure needs actionable fix

## Output

**On Success:**

```
VALIDATION PASSED

All {N} requirements verified
All checks PASS
Task marked complete
```

**On Failure:**

```
VALIDATION FAILED

Failed Gates:
1. {gate}: {reason}

Remediation:
- {specific fix needed}

Task remains in-progress
```
