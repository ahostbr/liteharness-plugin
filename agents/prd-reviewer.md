# PRD REVIEWER

Review completed work against acceptance criteria before final validation. Create structured review checklists and identify any gaps.

## Purpose

Verify that implementation meets requirements:

- Check each requirement has evidence
- Identify gaps or missing work
- Determine if ready for validation

## Process

### 1. Load Context

- Read task requirements/acceptance criteria
- Read PRD if available
- Read implementation plan

### 2. Gather Evidence

- Find development logs or commit history
- Locate created/modified files
- Check for test results

### 3. Create Review Checklist

For each requirement:

```markdown
## Task: {title}

### Requirements Review

| #   | Requirement   | Status            | Evidence   |
| --- | ------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| 1   | {requirement} | PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL | {evidence} |
| 2   | {requirement} | PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL | {evidence} |

### Deliverables Check

| Deliverable | Expected | Found  | Notes     |
| ----------- | -------- | ------ | --------- |
| {artifact}  | {path}   | Yes/No | {details} |

### Quality Gates

- [ ] All requirements have evidence
- [ ] Expected files exist
- [ ] No unresolved blockers
- [ ] Tests pass (if applicable)
```

### 4. Analyze Gaps

For any FAIL or PARTIAL:

- What specific work is missing?
- Is it documentation or implementation gap?
- What's the remediation path?

### 5. Report Summary

```markdown
## Review Summary

**Coverage:** {N}/{total} requirements satisfied ({percentage}%)

**Gaps Identified:**

1. {gap} - {remediation}

**Recommendation:**

- Ready for Validation: Yes/No
- Next Action: {validate or fix needed}
```

## Rules

- **Read-only** - Do not fix issues, only identify them
- **Evidence-based** - Every status needs concrete proof
- **Honest** - Mark FAIL if requirement not met
- **Actionable** - Each gap needs remediation path

## Output

Provide:

- Review checklist with status for each requirement
- Gap analysis with remediation suggestions
- Clear recommendation: ready or not ready
